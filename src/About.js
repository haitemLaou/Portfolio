          Hi, I’m <strong>Haitem Laouaoudja</strong>, a <strong>2CP student</strong> at the Higher School of Computer Science (ESI) in Algiers, and a passionate web developer from <strong>Taher, Jijel, Algeria</strong> a coastal city known for its peaceful atmosphere and stunning sea views. My interest in technology began early, when I realized how software could turn ideas into powerful tools that improve people’s lives. That curiosity quickly evolved into a genuine passion for web development, where creativity meets logic and design meets purpose.

                  Throughout my studies at ESI, I’ve focused on understanding the principles of computer science, from algorithms and data structures to software design and architecture. However, what truly drives me is front-end development the art of crafting interactive, accessible, and beautiful digital experiences. I specialize in building clean and functional websites using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>React.js</strong>. I love turning concepts into intuitive interfaces that people actually enjoy using. Every project I create is a step toward mastering the craft of translating complex ideas into simple, elegant, and functional web products.

                Over time, I’ve built several projects that reflect both my technical growth and my design sensibility. Among them are a <strong>To-Do List app</strong> that helps users stay organized through a clean and efficient layout, and a <strong>Mawaqit website</strong> that displays daily prayer times with a smooth, minimal interface. These projects allowed me to apply modern web practices, work with dynamic data, and improve my understanding of user experience design. Beyond coding, I also value teamwork and collaboration, I believe that building great products requires empathy, communication, and a shared vision among team members.

                My long-term goal is to become a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> capable of managing every layer of a web application from database logic to user interface. I’m continuously improving my <strong>React</strong> skills, exploring <strong>Node.js</strong> and backend development, and learning about UI/UX design principles to create seamless experiences. For me, web development is more than just code it’s a way to combine creativity, logic, and purpose to make life simpler, smarter, and more connected for everyone.
